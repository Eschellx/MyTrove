        <h1><strong>About Me! :></strong></h1>
        <p>Hello! I am an undergraduate in university, studying to be an engineer, though I would much rather dream of being some kind of author/artist/mix to the two. I am currently a ssophomore and don't yet have any greats feats or coding projects to my name, unless you count this website itself, which I don't.</p>
        <p>I attended a couple of years of mock trial in highschool and like a single year of newspaper where I only worked on design. I have floated between clubs for college such as writing, consciousness, and Classics. I haven't participated in any of these for an extended period of time, and am currently searching for something I can genuinely put my all into participating for the latter two years of my undergraduate. However, I <i>have</i> steadily worked on my art and writing, despite my lack of commitment to club activites.</p>
        <p>I love cats.</p>
        <p>If you wish to find and speak to me, <span><a href="https://discordapp.com/users/726225408361496697here">here</a></span> is my discord</p>
