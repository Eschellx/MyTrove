        <p>My writing is one of my great passions. Though I will not consider them professional by any means, I do think that they are visible proof that I have the ability to be dedicated to something. My main writing account is <span><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/Phosphell">Phosphell</a></span> on ao3, although I will aslo display a couple of my works on here.</p>
        <p>I have several short stories I will display, including one of my original characters' <a href="Writing!/Maya (1).pdf" target="_blank" title="Read PDF">backstories</a>, and a dark prompt about what it's like to have a <a href="Writing!/Empathy.pdf" target="_blank" title="Read PDF">cursed superpower</a>.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I have a currently in progress long fanfiction (100k) words called Lily Flower. The following story can be found <a href="Writing!/Lily Flower (4).pdf" target="_blank" title="Read PDF">here</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I also plan to release an original long-form novel, and this website will contain the chapters, posted one by one. If you see my story on any website except this one, it is STOLEN. Please let me know if this occurs. Otherwise, enjoy:</p>
